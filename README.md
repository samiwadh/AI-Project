## About
## AI Projects Repository
- Welcome to my AI Projects repository! This repository contains various machine learning and artificial intelligence projects I have worked on, 
showcasing my development and research skills in the field. Below, you'll find details on each project along with instructions on how to run them.
## List

### First Project 
  - **[Plant Disease Detection](https://github.com/samiwadh/AI-Project/tree/main/Plant%20Disease%20Detection)**
    - This project utilizes deep learning to detect and classify diseases in plant leaves from image data. The aim is to assist in the early identification of diseases to improve agricultural outcomes.
